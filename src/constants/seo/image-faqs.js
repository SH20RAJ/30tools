    question: "What is image compression?",
    answer:
      "Image compression is the process of encoding digital images using fewer bits than the original representation. This reduces the file size of the image, making it faster to upload and download, and taking up less storage space.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I compress my images?",
    answer:
      "Compressing images is crucial for website performance. Smaller images load faster, improving user experience and SEO rankings. It also saves bandwidth and storage space on your devices and servers.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?",
    answer:
      "Lossy compression reduces file size by permanently removing some data, which may slightly affect image quality but offers significant size reduction (e.g., JPEG). Lossless compression reduces file size without losing any quality but offers less size reduction (e.g., PNG).",
  },
  {
    question: "Which image format compresses best?",
    answer:
      "WebP generally offers the best compression-to-quality ratio for the web, often being 25-35% smaller than comparable JPEG or PNG images. However, JPEG is still excellent for photographs, and PNG is best for images with transparency or text.",
