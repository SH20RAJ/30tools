# Agent Guidelines for 30tools

- Markdown placement: All documentation files (`*.md`) must live under `docs/`. The only allowed Markdown file in the repository root is `AGENTS.md`.
- Subfolders: Use `docs/seo`, `docs/deploy`, `docs/tools`, `docs/content`, and `docs/misc` to keep topics organized.
- Artifacts: Place generated reports under `reports/` and development datasets like CSVs under `data/`.
- Root hygiene: Keep the project root free of docs and temporary artifacts; do not leave Markdown or ad-hoc files at the root.
- Scope: These rules apply to the entire repository tree rooted here. More deeply nested `AGENTS.md` files (if added later) take precedence for their subtrees.
